## Test Descriptions

```text
- App Component Tests:
  - Loading State: Verifies that loading skeletons are displayed while data is being fetched.
  - Successful Data Fetch: Confirms that character cards are displayed when data is successfully fetched.
  - Error State: Checks that an error message is displayed when data fetching fails.
- CharacterCardItem Component Tests:
  - Render Character Details: Ensures the characterâ€™s name, birth year, and eye color are correctly displayed.
  - Click Event: Verifies that clicking the character card triggers the onClick handler with the correct character data.
```
These tests ensure that the components render correctly, respond to state changes, and handle user interactions as expected.
